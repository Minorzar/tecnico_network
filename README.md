# Network science Lab
### Group 18

This repository will contain our work for the Network science lab. We have choosen the subject 30:

### Implement a computer simulation of the SIS model in a given network. Compute the epidemic threshold for lattices, random graphs, BA model networks and minimal model. Discuss the results.

Depending on the time we spend on this subject, it may evolve with a change in the model (SIS &rarr; SIR).
